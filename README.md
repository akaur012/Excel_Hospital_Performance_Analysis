# Hospital_Performance_Analysis  
This project analyzes hospital performance by examining ownership distribution, readmission rates, safety scores, and overall ratings. Key insights reveal that non-profit hospitals dominate, acute care hospitals have the highest readmissions, and higher safety scores donâ€™t always mean better ratings. Using Excel, I applied pivot tables, charts, and statistical analysis to uncover trends that can help optimize hospital partnerships and improve patient care strategies.

Key Insights from Hospital Data Analysis  
1. Distribution of Hospitals by Ownership  
- Voluntary non-profit private hospitals make up 50% of all hospitals, indicating that non-profit organizations dominate the healthcare sector.
- Proprietary (for-profit) hospitals account for 17%, representing a smaller share of healthcare institutions.
- Government-run hospitals are distributed across multiple levels, including federal, state, local, and hospital district authorities, highlighting the diversity of public healthcare institutions.
- Voluntary non-profit hospitals, including private, church-affiliated, and other non-profit models, constitute the majority of hospitals, emphasizing the role of community-driven healthcare.  
  
  
2. Hospital Type vs. Readmission Rate  
- Acute Care Hospitals have the highest average readmission rate (8.3), likely due to higher patient turnover and more complex medical conditions.
- Critical Access Hospitals have lower readmission rates (6.3), suggesting that smaller hospitals may provide more personalized post-discharge care.
- Veterans Administration hospitals have the lowest readmissions (5.4), which could be attributed to integrated care models and long-term patient management.
Implication:  
- Hospitals with higher readmission rates should implement stronger post-discharge follow-up programs to reduce unnecessary returns and improve patient outcomes.
